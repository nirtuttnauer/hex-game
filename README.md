# Hex Game

## Description
The Hex Game is a strategic board game implemented in Python. It involves two players, 'red' and 'blue', who alternately place their colored stones on a hexagonal grid. The objective is for a player to form an unbroken chain of stones between two opposite sides of the board. The game uses advanced data structures, including disjoint sets, to manage game state and determine the winner efficiently.
